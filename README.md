# KaiDowSE
Our First POS project using 
- react js + Material-UI (front-end)
- Express js + Firebase Function (back-end)
- Socket io (back-end)
- Omise (payment gateway)\
*******  The reason that we have 2 back-end because Firebase Function is not made for long-running processes like Socket io *******
